In this file you will find the developpement of some dbt models from the course under the subfolder "course".
The homeworks are in the md file "homeworks.md" and you can see an HTML file with a dashboard. I really hate looker studio and i missed time so I have done the bare minimum.

I'm really proud about my dbt developpement, even if there is no tests or documentation yet (no time), but I will keep working on dbt.
